Examples: 
	Friendships in network in karate clubs
	Human mobility network
	Bus transportation

	COmmunication between left and right wing political blogs
	Internet connectivity
	In general, there seems to be a lot of clustering

SUmmary: Many complex structures can be modeled by networks

Network Definition and Vocabulary

Network (or graph): A representation of connections among a set of items
	Items are called nodes
	Connections are called edges

2 kinds of edges: 
	Undirected network
	Directed network: edges have direction

Weighted networks: 
	Note all relationships are equal
	Some edges carry higher weight than others

Signed Network:
	a network where edge are assigned positive or negatiev sign

Edges can carry many other labels or attributes: friend, coworker, family, etc

Multigraphs: 
A pair of nodes can have different types of relationhships simultaneosly. Different edges between a pair of graphs

Bipartite Graphs: 
L-bipartite graph projection: Network on nodes in a group L, where a pair of nodes is connected if they have a common neighbor in R in the bipartite graph. 

Quiz answers: 
1) 
Weighted networks are used to describe networks with unequal relationships between nodes.

When there are only two opposite relationships between nodes, a signed network is a good representation.

2)Multi graph
3)direted weighted netowrk
4)
Edges can carry many labels or attributes.

Accessing node or edge attributes in NetworkX is the same as accessing values in a Python dictionary

Suppose we have created a nx.Graph()object G with some nodes and edges. The statement G.nodes(data=True) will return a list of tuples.

5) dictionary
6)G.edge['A']['B'][0]['relation']
