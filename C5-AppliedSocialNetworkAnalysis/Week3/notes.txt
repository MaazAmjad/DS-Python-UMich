Degree and Closeness Centrality:
Network centrality: 
	Centrality measures identigy the most important nodes in a netowrk

Degree centrality: 
	Important nodes have many connections
	The most basic measure of centrality: number of neighbors
	Undirected networks: use degree
	Directed networks: use in degree or out degree

Closeness centrality: 
	Important nodes are close to other nodes
	closeCent = nx.closeness_centrality(G)

Betweenness centrality: 
Assumption: important nodes connect other nodes
Recall: the distance between two nodes is the length of the shortest path between them. 

Normalization: Divide by number of pairs of nodes
Approximation: COmputing betweenness centrality can be computationally expensive, we can approximate computation by taking a subset of nodes
Subsets: we can define substs of source and target nodes to compute betweenness centrality
Edge betweenness centrality: we can apply the same framework to find important edges instead of nodes


Basic Page Rank: 

Assigns a score of important to each node. Important nodes are those with many in-links from important pages. Mainly used for directed networks. Rank depends on the pagerank of other nodes. 

1) All node start with pagerank of 1/n
2) perform the basic pagerank update rule k times
	- each node gives an equal share of its current pagerank to all the nodes it links to 
	- the new pagerank of each node is the sum of all pagerank it received from other nodes

Nodes with fewer in-degrees may have a high Page Rank when they are connected to a more important node.
