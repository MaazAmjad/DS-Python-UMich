This is my second take of this class. I want to get better at Data Visualization and gonna keep at it. 

Week 1 Notes: 
PRINCIPLES OF INFORMATION VISUALIZATION

Introdction Lecture: 
    Info Vis: THeoretical basis for best practices
    Alberto Cairo and Edward Tufty

Tools for Thinking about Design (Alberto Cairo):

    Vis Wheel: Compare ways of visualizing information 
        Abstraction vs FIguration 
        Functionality vs Decoration
        Density of info vs Lightness of info
        Multidimensional vs Unidimensional
        Originality vs Familiarity
        Novelty vs Redundancy

Graphical heuristics: Data-ink ratio (Edward Tufte)

    Data-ink Ratio: Not erasable core of a graph 
        Amount of data ink / total area of graphic
        Remove elements of redundant information

Graphical heuristics: Chart junk (Edward Tufte): 

    Chart Junk: 
        Bad: Stripes, Grids
        Good: Directly labeling data
    Lie Factor and Spark Lines: 
        Spark Lines: Where trends and distributions of data is important

The Truthful Art (Alberto Cairo): 
    5 part framework for qualities of information: 
    - Truthful
    - Functionality
    - Beauty
    - Insightful
    - Enlightening


Week 2: Basic Charting

Matplotlib Architecture: 
    Backend Layer: 
        Deals with the rendering of plots to screen or files
    Artist Layer: 
        Contains contrainers such as Figure, Subplot and Axes
        Contains primitives such as Line2D and Rectangle, and collections, such as PathCollection
    Scripting Layer: 
        Simplifies access to the Artist and Backend Layer
